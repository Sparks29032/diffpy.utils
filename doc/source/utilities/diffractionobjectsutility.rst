Diffraction Objects Utility
===========================

The ``diffpy.utils.diffraction_objects`` module provides functions
for managing and analyzing diffraction data, including angle-space conversions
and interactions between diffraction data.

These functions help developers standardize diffraction data and update the arrays
in the associated ``DiffractionObject``, enabling easier analysis and further processing.

For a more in-depth tutorial for how to use these functions, click :ref:`here <Diffraction Objects Example>`.
